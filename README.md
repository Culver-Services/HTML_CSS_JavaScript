The Tech Academy Course and Exercises

Project Description:

This is a collection of all excercises that I have completed while attending The Tech academy. The course where designed to be both instructor lead but emphasized hands on experience and training. As you proceed though the various repositories you will note that The Tech Academies goal was to provide its students with the knowledge needed to enter into the proffesion as well as the tools needed to continue to excel.
